# Tabby Config Sync

English | [中文](README_ZH.md)

A simple service for syncing Tabby configurations.

It implements the configuration synchronization function of [tabby-web](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby-web) and provides a basic management interface.

## Why develop this project?

As of now, the tabby-web project is no longer maintained, and its OAuth functionality is malfunctioning, making it unusable.

Therefore, I developed this simple project to solve the problem of syncing tabby client configurations, as other features are not necessary for my use case.
